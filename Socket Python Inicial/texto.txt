PORT = 5050 
#SERVER = "192.168.1.211"
SERVER = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) #automaticamente toma nuestro ipv4
print(SERVER)
print(socket.gethostname()) #the name of our computer in the network

#necesitamos saber la direcion ipv4. cmd -> ipconfig

time.sleep(1) #we wait one second and then print out hello 
print("hello")



def start():
    pass 

    inside start I am going is essentially write the code that's goingto allow
    our server to start listening  for connections and then handling those connections 
    and passing them to handle clients which will run in a new threat.

    conn, addr = server.accept() this line of code here for a new connection to the server when
    a new connections occurs we will store the address of the connection, so what Ip adress 
    and what port it came from and then we will store an actual object thatÂ´s going to allowus
    to senf information back to the connection. 



def handle_client(conn, addr):
    pass 

    this function her are handle all the communications between the clients in between
    the server from now on so this little function here is meant to simply handle 
    new connection and kind of  distribute those to where they need to go whereas 
    here will handle the individual connection between the client and the server so one client 
    and one server.
    this is gonna run for each client 



    while connected:
        msg = conn.recv() # we don't pass this line of code until we receive a message from 
        our client 

    How are we gonna know how many bytes to receive from the client 
    
HEADER = 64 #bytes
Length of the message that's gonna come with 64 bytes 


so if we want to send a message back to the client what I 'll do is I'll just implement in the 
function handle_client 
conn.send("Msg received".encode(FORMAT))
